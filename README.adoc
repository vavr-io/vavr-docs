== Performing Updates

* Ensure that `GITHUB_USER` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` variables are set in your environment.

* Update the version in `gradle.properties`. Please note that the version in the Maven section of `getting_started.adoc` currently has to be updated manually.
* Write documentation and test results with `./gradlew asciidoc`. If the Vavr API has changed, some code example tests might fail.
* Then `git commit`, `git push` and `./gradlew publishGhPages`
